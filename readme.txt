JVM converts Byte Code into machine Code

- Whenever we create a java program the extension will be .java and the file name would be the same as the class name
- The program that we write is called the source Code
- Source code is converted into byte code using javac (i.e java compiler)
     - Use javac file_name.java
     - Using the above command a byte code file is created with the extension .class
     - This byte file can be executed in any machine having a JVM
     - To run the byte code use -> java file_name
